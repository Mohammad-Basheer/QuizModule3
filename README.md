#Data science is already a very popular field. One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

#This repository contains the following files:
#1. The READ.Me file that describes what this project is and how the student created the required files.
#2. The run_analysis.R which contains the codes needed to create the text file.
#This code will be used to perform the assignment instructions for the Week 4 Peer graded assignment.
#It will be able to merge the training and test sets in one data set using the read.table, cbind, and rbind functions
#while extracting the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement using the select function.
#It will also use descriptive names to name the activities in the data set using the gsub function and
#will appropriately label the data set.
#Finally, by using the write.table data, this code will create a test file where the result of this code is stored.

#3. The code book which describes the variables and summaries calculated, etc.
#4. The tidy data set avedata.txt produced by the run_analysis.R code.
